# Eloquent Javascript Exercises

This is a repo of my solutions for the exercises in Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke.

## Install the VS Code Extension: Code Runner

I'm testing these functions in the VS Code Output using the extension Code Runner. Use the shortcut ctrl + alt + n to run the code.

## Have a better solution?

These are just my solutions to the exercises. If you have a better/different solution, I'm happy to check it out. Learning and growing should be every developers goal.
